#Learning isn’t (just) doing.

I started meditating 23 days ago.

On my first three days, I saw an improvement. I started noticing my surroundings, and was able to be present in a way I hadn’t previously known was possible.

I thought, this is great! There’s an improvement I’m making here, so I might as well keep at it.

The next twenty days were tough. Some days I did well, some days horribly. I had convinced myself that I was doing something good, so I kept at it.

On day 23 (today), I had a breakthrough. Something felt different. I was aware, but I was objective. I was “fully present”. Now, this isn’t about meditation per se, but I want to talk about what happened on day 23.

I leaned in. I was examining what I was doing, and tweaking the practice. I saw an opening in the way I was doing it, and decided to explore the possibility of tweaking what I was doing. 

I imagine that a lot of this won’t make sense to someone who’s never tried meditating, which, coincidentally, I recommend, but the point here is this:

“Examining what you’re doing at any given moment from a learning perspective is just as, if not more important that just ‘trying’ something. That is to say, get off your butt and do something, but when you’re doing it, be objective, and learn from your experience.

Question what you’re doing. Question how you do it.

Over time, you’ll see incremental improvements, and eventually, exponential improvements.
